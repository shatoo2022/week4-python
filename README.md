# 📂 Python File Handling & Error Handling Assignment

This project demonstrates **file handling** and **error handling** in Python.  
It is divided into two main parts:  

1. **File Read & Write Challenge** 🖋️  
2. **Error Handling Lab** 🧪  

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🖋️ Part 1: File Read & Write Challenge
- Reads the contents of an input file (`input.txt`)  
- Modifies the content (in this case, converts text to uppercase)  
- Writes the modified content into a new file (`output.txt`)  

### 🧪 Part 2: Error Handling Lab
- Asks the user for a filename to read  
- Displays the file’s content if it exists  
- Handles errors gracefully if:
  - The file does not exist ❌  
  - The user does not have permission 🚫  
  - Any other unexpected error ⚠️
